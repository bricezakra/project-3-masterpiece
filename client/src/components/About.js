         <p>
            Wi-Finder is an app that locates all free wifi locations in the
            city of New York, and the app is currently in progress of becoming nationwide.
            Our backend team which includes Brice Zakra and Randall Fields added features that
            makes each wifi location interactive. It will show the location name and address, and
            whether it is an outdoor kiosk, subway station, etc.
